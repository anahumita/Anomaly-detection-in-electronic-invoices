# Anomaly-detection-in-electronic-invoices
Currently working on my bachelor thesis titled "Anomaly Detection in Electronic Invoices". This project focuses on automating error detection to improve efficiency and reduce costs.Using a diverse dataset, including real and AI-generated invoices, it identifies anomalies quickly and reliably. By integrating advanced algorithms with financial insights, the system enhances accuracy and strengthens cybersecurity in invoice management.
Technology used: TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Keras, Matplotlib.
